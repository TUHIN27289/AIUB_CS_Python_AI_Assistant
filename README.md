Drawing Shapes: There is a drawing module that can create and display basic shapes like circles, triangles, rectangles, and ellipses.

Voice Output: The assistant can speak back to the user to provide information or confirm actions.

Prime Number Checking: It can check whether a given number is prime or not.

Modular Code: The code is modular, making it easy to add more functionalities or commands.

This script provides a foundation for building a voice-controlled assistant with various capabilities. Users can extend it further by adding more voice commands and integrating additional APIs and functionalities.
